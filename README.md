#Josh Leedam Photography

I am creating this project in order to showcase Josh Leedam's Photography. I will be using HTML and CSS to create a website 
containing four pages. A home page, a page of the photographers work, a page containing a brief history of the photographer
 and a contact page.

 ##UX

 * As a user I can see what the main focus of the website.
 * As a user I can navigate myself to any social media the photographer has.
 * As a user I can navigate myself through the additional pages efficiently and effectively.
 * As a user I can view the photograpers work.
 * As a user I can fill out a form registering for newsletters.
 * As a user I can contact the photographer in regards to purchasing work or offering contracts

 ##Features

 * A navigation bar allowing users to scroll through the different pages.
 * Social links opening the associated web pages in a new window.
 * A photo page featuring a slider to showcase the photographers work.
 * A newsletter form for registering to receive monthly newsletters.
 * A contact form for contacting the photographer for any forms of interest.
